                <h2>What is the WRC?</h2>
                <p>The World Rally Championship (WRC) is the highest level of international rally racing. Unlike traditional circuit racing, rallies take place on public roads and closed-off tracks, often in extreme conditions. The championship features a series of events, or "rallies," held in different countries each year, with each rally consisting of multiple "special stages."</p>

                <h3>How a WRC Rally Works</h3>
                <p>A WRC rally is a time trial. Each team, consisting of a driver and a co-driver, races against the clock on each stage. The co-driver, or navigator, reads pace notes to the driver, providing detailed descriptions of the road ahead, including turns, obstacles, and braking points. The total time for all stages determines the winner of the rally.</p>

                <h3>The Cars and Teams</h3>
                <p>WRC cars are based on production models but are heavily modified to handle the grueling conditions of rally racing. The top-tier cars are known as the **Rally1** class, which features hybrid powertrainsâ€”a 1.6-liter turbocharged engine paired with a 100 kW electric motor. Major manufacturers, such as Toyota, Hyundai, and Ford, compete in the championship with their own factory teams.</p>

                <h2>The Role of the Co-Driver</h2>
                <p>The co-driver is a critical component of a rally team. Their job is to read and interpret the pace notes accurately and in real-time, allowing the driver to know what to expect around every corner. This precise communication is what enables drivers to push the limits of their cars on unfamiliar and dangerous roads.</p>

                <h2>WRC vs. Other Motorsports</h2>
                <p>The WRC is unique in the world of motorsports for its focus on driver skill and car durability in real-world environments. While disciplines like Formula 1 or NASCAR race on purpose-built tracks, WRC drivers must adapt to surfaces ranging from asphalt and gravel to snow and ice. This diversity of challenges makes WRC one of the most demanding and dynamic forms of motorsport.</p>
